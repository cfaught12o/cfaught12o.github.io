			<h2>Things About Me</h2>

		<p>One thing about me is that I like to game. Typically I like to play either Console or PC. I do play Mobile games a bit but I personally find that there aren't that many good Mobile games out there. Console(s) that I have played in my entire life are Xbox, Xbox360, Xbox One, Playstation, Playstation 2, Playstation 3, Playstation 4, Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo Switch, Atari, and Gamecube. Other Game related like "consoles" would be like Gameboy, DS, and 3DS. Personally I would have to say that PC is better than consoles, since you can build and customize PC's more with specs to make them better than consoles. But personally I have to say too I grew up with the old retro game consoles and Playstation, which I love them all.

		<p>Another thing about me is the pets that I currently have. I currenty have about 25 cats, 2 dogs, 1 chinchilla, and 1 hamster. The most pets that I've ever had in my house was 2 ducks, 80+ cats, 2 dogs, 1 chinchilla, and 1 hamster. Personally I would have to say that... If you ever have a pet. Make sure that they're fixed. Cause. If you don't, then you risk putting yourself through a lot of stuff. I am pretty sure that I am the only teenager in the world that has ever had to deal with what I had to deal with. Which I dealt with these things for over 3 years. While being in school too and having to deal with it. It is not fun and it makes life a lot more stressful and complicated.

		<p>Lastly, a thing about me is my family. I am the youngest sibling out of my family. But I am also the only Son in my family. I live in a household in a family of 6. My Mother, Father, and my 3 Sisters, lastly including me.
